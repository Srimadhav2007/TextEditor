# About the Project:
###     This TextEditor is supposed to be a fun environment to encode whatever we want to type into pre-defined mapping for the characters
###     Used Java Swing

# Improvements in mind:
##  1. Add copy-paste, delete, undo, redo to make it even closer to a proper text editor
##  2. Enhance the UI
##  3. Change the used classes to better ones(like shift to DocumentFilters)
##  4. Add a face-detection(or some fun security measure kinda)
##  5. Make a cross-platform application
##  6. Optimisation
